Project Status: In Progress

This project is a full-stack Airbnb clone built using the MERN stack â€“ MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 
It replicates key features of the Airbnb platform, including property listings, user authentication, booking functionality, and more. 
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development and understand how different technologies integrate in a real-world application.
The core backend functionalities and major components of the frontend are already in place. 
However, the project is still a work in progress. 
I am currently focusing on making the user interface more visually appealing and intuitive to navigate. 
In addition, I am working on adding responsive design to ensure the application works seamlessly across all screen sizes and devices.

As development continues, I plan to refine the UX, handle edge cases, and implement additional features to make the app more robust and production-ready.

Feel free to explore the code and stay tuned for updates!
